-------
- Updated bundled ModuleManger to 4.2.3

 - Effects on inactive versions of parts (e.g. multiple part variants) are no longer evaluated
 - Effects that use controllers that don't exist on a part won't be evaluated
 - Effects only update if one of their controller values changed or they have random inputs
 - Effect modifiers don't re-evaluate curves if the controller value didn't change
 - Integrated gotmachine's faster FloatCurve implementation
 - Many minor optimizations and cleanups that add up to large improvements
 - Some memory leaks fixed
- Fixed engine light layers targeting IVA layers (#130)
- Thrust and Throttle controllers can now have their EngineID set in the UI (#125)
- Added a UI option for Perlin noise to have its seed to an option that will randomize it on effect startup (#127)
- It is now possible to set Engine ID in Engine Event Controllers, and those controllers will only fire on events asocaited with that engine ID (#126)
- Fixed Enable Distortion setting actually doing nothing
- Added a setting toggle to treat random controllers as unchanging, which improves performance at the cost of randomness
- Various logging cleanups and improvements

- Shader improvements
 - Additive (Volumetric) shader:
  - fixed excessive noise bug
  - the _Noise setting is now 5 times more sensitive (divide your old _Noise setting by 5 to get previous behavior)
  - you may need to slightly increase your _FadeOut setting if your old setting was below 0.5
  - start and end tints will no longer depend on Fresnel or InvertedFresnel settings (so your old color gradient may need some readjustments)
  - added FresnelFadeIn setting so you can gradually fade in the Fresnel effect starting from the nozzle exit.
 - Echo (Dynamic) shader:
  - echo spacing (_EchoLength) setting will now properly scale with the mesh scale
