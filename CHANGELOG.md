# Unreleased

- Fixed a regression in the randomness controller. Effects that used a RandomnessController created prior to 0.10.0 did not include a new required configuration field to determine whether the controller used a randomized seed, which was being defaulted to False. This has been changed to default to True, which is a more generally correct default.

# v0.10.5

- Fix remap controller that was not working after fixes in 0.10.0
- Add new Engine On/Off controller: returns 0 if an engine is off, 1 if on. 
- Add new Scalar Module controller: returns state of an IScalarModule (e.g. ModuleAnimateGeneric, ModuleAnimateHeat, ModuleColorChanger, etc)
- Fix some additional ungated log calls

# v0.10.4

- Removed a few log messages that were not gated behind flags correctly

# v0.10.3

- Fixed an issue where certain effects would miss their first update (SEP, Tundra RCS blocks) and get stuck in a bad state

# v0.10.2

- Fixed an issue with shader compilation on OpenGL (#173)
- Fixed a test particle patch from development still being around
- Fixed an issue with effects not being updated when their controller value changed if they had a modifier that would hide them sometimes (#174)
- Fixed an issue with custom push controllers where they they would not sleep/wake up correctly

# v0.10.1

- Fixed some debug switches being on in settings

# v0.10.0

- Updated bundled ModuleManger to 4.2.3
- Large swathe of performance updates thanks to JohnnyOThan, including:
 - Effects on inactive versions of parts (e.g. multiple part variants) are no longer evaluated
 - Effects that use controllers that don't exist on a part won't be evaluated
 - Effects only update if one of their controller values changed or they have random inputs
 - Effect modifiers don't re-evaluate curves if the controller value didn't change
 - Integrated gotmachine's faster FloatCurve implementation
 - Many minor optimizations and cleanups that add up to large improvements
 - Some memory leaks fixed
- Fixed engine light layers targeting IVA layers (#130)
- Thrust and Throttle controllers can now have their EngineID set in the UI (#125)
- Added a UI option for Perlin noise to have its seed to an option that will randomize it on effect startup (#127)
- It is now possible to set Engine ID in Engine Event Controllers, and those controllers will only fire on events asocaited with that engine ID (#126)
- Fixed Enable Distortion setting actually doing nothing
- Added a setting toggle to treat random controllers as unchanging, which improves performance at the cost of randomness
- Various logging cleanups and improvements
- Reworked most Editor window UIs to look cleaner and work better, including a lot of UI code cleanup for more coherency
- Added the ability to load arbitrary particle assets from assetbundles and control them
 - Controllability is limited

# v0.9.0

- Significant stack of performance updates that should increase performane significantly on ships/templates with lots of effects (big thanks to Al2Me6, DRVeyl, JohnnyOThan)

# v0.8.2

- Fix to procedural particles shader

# v0.8.1

- Fix compatibility with KSP < 1.12

# v0.8.0

- Significant rewrite of controller and controller UI code. This resulted in a change to how generated configs look, but existing configs should work fine (thanks ArXen42 for all the hard work for this)
- Improvements to UX for controller selection and configuration
- Added an error notification when you try to add an effect with an invalid effect parent
- Some refactoring of UI code in various areas
- Redid color picker for significantly better UX
- Added the ability to save (within a game session) color swatches to copy/paste between effects and materials
- Shader bundles can now be loaded from anywhere in gamedata (anything with a .waterfallshaders extension)
- Shader bundles are loaded alphabetically and replace existing shaders in the order loaded. e.g if xyz.waterfallshaders contains a shader with the same name as abc.waterfallshaders, the one from xyz.waterfallshaders will be used
- Shader improvements
 - Additive (Volumetric) shader:
  - fixed excessive noise bug
  - the _Noise setting is now 5 times more sensitive (divide your old _Noise setting by 5 to get previous behavior)
  - you may need to slightly increase your _FadeOut setting if your old setting was below 0.5
  - start and end tints will no longer depend on Fresnel or InvertedFresnel settings (so your old color gradient may need some readjustments)
  - added FresnelFadeIn setting so you can gradually fade in the Fresnel effect starting from the nozzle exit.
 - Echo (Dynamic) shader:
  - echo spacing (_EchoLength) setting will now properly scale with the mesh scale
  - new _ExpandLength setting stretches the individual echos
