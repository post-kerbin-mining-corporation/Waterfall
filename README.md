## Features

Waterfall is a mod for Kerbal Space Program that provides a cool new way to create and drive engine effects for smooth rocket plumes. It provides
* Support for atmospheric expansion and all kinds of dynamic effects
* Cross-compatible with SmokeScreen for adding smoke effects
* Ingame editor to create and drive effects. 
* A set of template effects to use on your engines 

This is a framework mod and **does nothing by itself**. Pick up a mod that supplies configs in order to have some effect on your game

## Dependencies

### Required
These components are required for the mod to function and are bundled as part of any download:
* [ModuleManager (4.2.3)](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager)

## Installation

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, please do so.

NOTE: Do NOT rename or move folders within the GameData folder - this mod uses absolute paths to assets and will break if this happens.

## Contributing

I certainly accept pull requests. Please target all such things to the `dev` branch though!
